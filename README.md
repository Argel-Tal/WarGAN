# WarGAN
Creating a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate images of models in the Warhammer INQ28 style, based on images drawn from the community.

Project is being done as part of a article for 28Mag: https://28-mag.com/, focusing on creative engines as a form of art, and a way to visualise the community's collective understanding/memory of INQ28.

Core of this program is now working!! Whoop!! Behold, the first dreamings of the machine:
- Img1: First dream
- Img2: Network suffered Mode Collapse, Generator got too good at beating the Discriminator, but made a fun ink blob
