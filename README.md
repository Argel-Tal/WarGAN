# WarGAN
Creating a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate images of models in the Warhammer INQ28 style, based on images drawn from the community.

Project is being done as part of a article for 28Mag: https://28-mag.com/, focusing on creative engines as a form of art, and a way to visualise the community's collective understanding/memory of INQ28.

Core of this program is now working!! *Whoop!!* Behold, the first dreamings of the machine:
- Img1: First dream
- Img2: Network suffered Mode Collapse, Generator got too good at beating the Discriminator, but made a fun ink blob

Still playing around with model parameters at the moment, hunting for something that doesn't collapse, and which gives distinct images, that also fit the INQ28 style. 

*.h5* model file is too large to upload to Github. Will find a work around, hosting it somewhere else, so people can use the generator file to create local instances
